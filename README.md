# KimchistanFrontEnd

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/CraftAcademy/Kimchistan-FrontEnd/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/CraftAcademy/Kimchistan-FrontEnd)


Final project for the August 2017 cohort.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.


We were approched by a client who wanted a website for a restaurant, where customers can order food online and pick it up at the restaurant after 30 minutes.


## First release
In the first release we put focus on the basic requirement for a functional website, while still aiming to fit the clients conditions regarding the styling. 

A customer can visit the website and get restaurant information, choose a dish with a specific ingredient, and pay for the order. After an order is placed and paid for, the kitchen receives an email with pick up and order details. 

Other features:
* Displaying a map of the restaurant location
* Showing restaurant info in the footer
* Showing order instructions over the header background picture
* The order details show up in a sticky collapsable header after a product gets added to the cart
* In the cart header a user can remove from cart, clear cart, and pay with Stripe.
* Allowing a user to click a dish picture to open a modal with a larger picture and dish description
* Daily dishes rotates during Monday-Friday
* Unavailable dishes and ingredients are disabled and can't be added to cart
* The cart information is stored in localstorage so the page can get refreshed
* Localstorage gets cleared at midnight
